Make sure to leave your email so we can provide updates about the wedding. Our ceremony time is still unconfirmed, so we will be sending info on that closer to the day! 


## Wedding Venue 
**[Mlýn na Dobré Vodě](http://www.mlynnadobrevode.cz/kontakt/)**

The venue is about a 20 minute drive from the Prague city centre. We would recommend getting an Uber, Bolt, or taxi to the venue itself, but please let us know if you would like any assistance arranging your transportation to the venue.

We are so excited to have you join our special day and your presence at our wedding is the best gift we could ask for. However, if you wish to give us a present, a contribution towards our honeymoon or home improvements would be very much appreciated. Please don't bring us physical gifts, we won't have a way of getting them back to Scotland.

We accept all currencies, choose whichever you like :D
