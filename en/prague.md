# Getting around Prague
## eSIM
If you have a phone with eSIM capabilities (iPhone XS and newer), we recommend getting a Czech eSIM to keep you connected while in Europe for cheap.

We've used a service called [Nomad](https://www.getnomad.app/en/czech-republic-eSIM) before which provides a data only eSIM for reasonable prices (about $5 for 1 GB for 7 days or $27 for 15GB for 30 days).

## Currency
The local currency is Czech Crown (CZK) (Česká Koruna/Kč in Czech). $1 is about 23 Kč, £1 is about 29 Kč, although the rates can fluctuate. 

Contactless cards and Apple Pay are accepted in most places, so it's unlikely you will need cash. Mastercard and Visa are universally accepted, but you might have issues with AMEX.

If you want to exchange some cash anyway, use [this map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1jmZ7dEkDNIqSePBPzWHHjSQ5_m_97rOK&ll=50.08196856173851%2C14.41933984999996&z=15) to find an honest exchange office near you. You can also use an ATM by an established bank, but avoid the yellow/blue ATMs that advertise in English, they charge large withdrawal fees.

While some restaurants will also accept Euros, this is often a sign of a tourist trap, and they will certainly offer a poor conversion rate, so just use your card.

When paying with a foreign card, the terminal might give you a choice of paying in your account's currency or in Czech Crowns (CZK). Choosing CZK is always a better deal, as it ensures the conversion rate is set by your bank and not by the payment provider, who often offer a worse rate. 

## Offline maps
To save on mobile data use you can also download maps into your phone. See [this guide](https://guidebooks.google.com/iphone/maps/how-to-navigate-offline-google-maps-iphone?hl=en-gb) for Google Maps, or download [mapy.cz](https://en.mapy.cz), a local app that makes downloading offline maps easy.
